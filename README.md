# Project Name: Dynamic Courses Store

## Introduction

Welcome to the Dynamic E-Commerce Store project! This project is designed to showcase a simple yet functional e-commerce website with dynamic features that can be loaded from JSON data. It offers a fully functional cart system and conditional price lists for an interactive shopping experience.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Loaded Data from JSON**

   - Easily load product information and pricing from JSON files.
   - Make changes to product listings without altering the codebase, simplifying maintenance and updates.

2. **Fully Functional Cart Option**

   - Add and remove items from your shopping cart.
   - View the total price of items in your cart in real-time.
   - Easily adjust quantities and update the cart without page reloads.

3. **Conditional Price Lists**
   - Implement conditional pricing based on various factors such as user type, membership status, or purchase quantity.
   - Define custom pricing rules and apply discounts or promotions automatically.

## How I manage the State?

I used the react hook useState to dynamically refresh the VIRTUAL DOM
and also the useEffect to deal with side effects in the projects such as api calling.
